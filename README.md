PROJECT TOPIC:
Property Rental Management System

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
A well-established property management system is a necessity for people to have an easy and efficient way to rent a property that they desire based on the location, address, and price. In a poorly organized and used property management system, keeping a huge number of tenant files could turn out to be tedious and can result in hours of confusion and redundancies.

1. Delay in solving maintenance issues or any other complaints.
2. Data in the database is prone to privilege abuse, injection attacks, and malware
threats.
3. Difficulty accessing and controlling the data due to the high number of properties.
   
OBJECTIVES:
Implementing a successful property management system is important as it is required by people who are moving to a new city or country to have a systematic interpretation of how they can easily get access to the unit according to their convenience and within their budget. The utmost priority of our project will be to appropriately use our technical and organizational skills to implement a safe and easy property management system that will act as a link between the owner and the tenant.
1. To efficiently manage the details of the Owners and their respective Tenants.
2. To create a well-organized management system for tracking maintenance issues from time to time.
3. To provide a structured system of maintaining financial transaction-related matters.
  
PROPOSED SOLUTION:
1. A different entity will be made to look after the problems of the tenants in different property locations.
2. Monitoring the database activity with the usage patterns will be done regularly.
3. User access rights and privileges will be managed and will not be given to the other users or the property owners.
4. A well-designed property system will be created that will be storing all the data in one place and have full control over it making the data transparent and easy to find.
